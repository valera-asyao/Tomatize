# Tomatize 🍅

* [***Русская версия***](README.md)

**Tomatize** is a habit tracker app with Tamagotchi-style gameplay.

## 📲 Description

- Helps you track good and bad habits in a game-like format: take care of a virtual pet by keeping up with your habits.
- Earn daily rewards for consistent habit tracking (Daily Reward).
- When creating this project, we were inspired by services like **Habitica**, **Pou**, and **TikTok** (regarding gamification and visual style).
- Each habit has its own progress; maintaining the pet is only possible by following your chosen habits.
